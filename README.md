Personnal website/portfolio hosted on github pages (because it is free).

This is the source code, the compiled code is in the ./docs directory.

The project is build using [svelte](https://svelte.dev/).

## Disclaimer

For now the website hasn't started, I just put my old website until this one is
started.

If you (for any reason) want to help, feel free to do it...
But keep in mind that this is my first project with svelte and typescript.
