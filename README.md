Personnal website/portfolio hosted on a raspberry pi.

[![Homepage looks](./docs/img/homePage.png)](https://matthiasg.dev)

This is the source code of my new website, the code on the website is the old one.

The project is build using [svelte](https://svelte.dev/).

## State of the project

The design has finished, I will first make the homepage.

## Other

If you (for any reason) want to help, feel free to do it...
But keep in mind that this is my first project with svelte and typescript.

## Cloning 
Once you cloned the repo, you need to add a `.env` file at the root of the project with a `DISCORD_WEBHOOK` constant that contains the end of a [discord webhook](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/webhook) url (`DISCORD_WEBHOOK="123456789101112131415161718/randomLettersNumbersAndCharachters"`)
